OS
You are working on windows.

Shell
You have a windows powershell to exectute commands.

Powershell does not support && to combine commands.
For example this will not work
python -m venv venv && .venv\Scripts\activate
PowerShell, doesn't support that syntax. 
Execute the commands separately.

Entry Point
Use main.py for argument parsing and overall flow.

Coding Conventions
You split large code blocks into managble files and classes.
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
Use docstrings, type hints, and linters (e.g., flake8).
Auto-format code with tools like black.
Modular Design

Group related classes/functions into separate files under modules.
Import them in main.py as needed.
Configuration

Store settings in settings.ini at the project root.
Parse these using Python’s configparser.
Dependencies

Maintain a requirements.txt file with all library dependencies.
Update it after adding new libraries (e.g., pip freeze > requirements.txt).
Use the latest stable versions for new features and fixes.
Execution

In main.py, parse arguments (if needed) and invoke core functions.
Use if **name** == "**main**": for direct script execution.
Use Virtual Environments

Create a venv (python -m venv venv) to isolate dependencies.
Activate it and install requirements (venv\Scripts\activate && pip install -r requirements.txt).

Implement Logging
Employ Python’s logging module with various log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
Adopt Exception Handling

Always use a logging class, do not use print statements directly.

Handle errors gracefully, with clear messages or fallback procedures.
Document & Automate

Keep a concise README.md explaining setup and usage.

Provide .bat files to automate setup and execution:
install.bat:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

run.bat:
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
