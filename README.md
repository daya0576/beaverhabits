# Getting Started

- Pricing Plans: https://beaverhabits.com

## Self-Hosting

### Unraid

Simply search for "Beaver Habit Tracker" in the Community Apps store!

### Ship with Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name beaverhabits \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -e HABITS_STORAGE=USER_DISK \
  -v ./beaver/:/app/.user/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  daya0576/beaverhabits:latest
```

Or Docker Compose:
```yaml
services:
  beaverhabits:
    container_name: beaverhabits
    user: 1000:1000 # User permissions of your docker or default user.
    environment:
      # See the link below to find all the environment variables
      # https://github.com/daya0576/beaverhabits/wiki/Development#options
      - HABITS_STORAGE=USER_DISK # DATABASE stores in a single SQLite database named habits.db. USER_DISK option saves in a local json file.
      - TRUSTED_LOCAL_EMAIL=your@email.com # Skip authentication
      - INDEX_HABIT_DATE_COLUMNS=5 # Customize the date columns for the index page.
      - ENABLE_IOS_STANDALONE=true
    volumes:
      - ./beaver/:/app/.user/ # Change directory to match your docker file scheme.
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: daya0576/beaverhabits:latest
```

P.S. The container starts as nobody to increase the security and make it OpenShift compatible.
To avoid [permission issues](https://github.com/daya0576/beaverhabits/discussions/31), ensure that the UID owning the host folder aligns with the UID of the user inside the container.


## Development

BeaverHabits favors [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/) as package management tool. Here is how to set up the development environment:

```sh
# Install uv and all the dependencies
uv venv && uv sync

# Start the server
./start.sh dev
```
